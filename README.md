# homebrew-tiger

This is a [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps)
for the [tigerbrew](https://github.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew) project,
a fork of [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for PowerPC Macs running OS X Tiger (10.4) or Leopard (10.5).
I use this tap to host [my](https://jason.pepas.com)
pre-built [bottles](https://docs.brew.sh/Bottles).

If you would like to use this tap:

```
$ brew tap ppcbrew/tiger
```

Then, to install a package:

```
$ brew update
$ brew install ppcbrew/tiger/some-package
```

I am currently building bottles on a G4 machine running tiger,
and will soon add a G3 and G5 to the fleet :)
