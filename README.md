# homebrew-tiger

This is a [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps)
for the [tigerbrew](https://github.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew) project,
a fork of [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
for [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC)
[Macs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh)
running OS X [Tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger) (10.4)
or [Leopard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Leopard) (10.5).

I use this tap to host [my](https://jason.pepas.com)
pre-built [bottles](https://docs.brew.sh/Bottles).

If you would like to use this tap:

```
$ brew tap ppcbrew/tiger
```

Then, to install a package:

```
$ brew update
$ brew install ppcbrew/tiger/some-package
```

I am currently building bottles on a G4 machine running tiger,
and will soon add a G3 and G5 to the fleet :)
